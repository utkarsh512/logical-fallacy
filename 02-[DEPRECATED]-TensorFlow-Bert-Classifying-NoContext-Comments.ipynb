the way to the test or is just a real asshole in general in this case im not snitching to uphold any particular notions of fairness or justice im doing it to make life just a little more painful for

anything with out evidence eventually evidence will be needed to prove guilt but you can still make an initial accusation heres the wiki on rape investigations httpenwikipediaorgwikirapeinvestigation and heres a page another page about the same httpswwwrainnorggetinformationaftermathofsexualassaultpreservingandcollectingforensicevidence now eventually the investigation will turn into a a said vs b said but you can say exactly the same thing about assault charges trespassing harassment or any other of the thousands of crimes that are primarily peer to peer in nature but because so often theres no evidence in a rape case its become acceptable for evidenceless accusations to be taken seriously please provide a citation that rape cases are abundantly prosecuted with absolutely no evidence heres a great example of this where a student is carrying around a mattress until their accused rapist is expelled httpwwwusatodaycomstorynewsnationnowemmasulkowitzcolumbiarapeperformanceart at that point what their doing has nothing to do with the legal system theyre just shaming the entire system until someone gives into their demands thats not how it works if theres not enough evidence to accuse someone of the crime if the court turns it down then you cant convict them period i agree that this is stupid slightly eye rollish but one needs to be cautious about drawing larger conclusions about complicated topics from the actions of the stupidestmost desperate person in the room\n","label: ah\n","\n","id: 783\n","comment: first of all sexual assault is punished severely these long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women and i rarely see anyone contesting these punishments it seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists first its not just about the rapist its about the victim also note that your statement only applies for a very specific subset of rape violent stranger rape anything other than violent rape becomes far harder to prosecute mainly because people tend to have a view that favors the rapist also when people offer advice regarding ways to avoid rape the rapist is still held culpable not always often the advice borders on doubting whether a rape even happened look at any girl assaulted while at a college party the rape culture which seeks to find what the woman did to deserve it gets in the way of the conviction or condemnation of the rapist probably not ive noticed that often when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future in fact when i lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago my entire family nagged me about how i should have kept it in a better pocket of course rape are thievery are different i completely acknowledge this however wheres the line between helpful advice and rape culture i think that some feminists confuse these two placing both of them in the realm of rape culture look there is a difference between victim blaming and honest advice giving the difference is when the tone shifts from how to prevent to you deserved it unfortunately the tone tends to be more on the latter camp\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 784\n","comment: so how do we make decisions based on science for example many states have laws that require vaccinations these laws were made by politicians who were elected by general public if general public remain ignorant about vaccines vaccines are science vast majority of people would then refuse vaccines because shots are painful and

the same as not having laws the laws in question exist only to achieve economic outcomes and breaking them is highly visible uber breaks them at their own risk and can be punished or fined they arent trying to hide the fact that they are breaking the law they are doing it in plain sight and accepting whatever consequences may occur if they lose a legal battle if the potential legal consequences

quantifiable does that mean i dont get pleasure from reading books it means that we cant quantify or objectively prove that you get pleasure from reading books if testimony wasnt evidence why is testimony admitted as evidence in a courtroom testimony is used to supplement physical evidence cases where eyewitness testimony is the only evidence available are regarded as weak cases for a reason of course this hasnt kept unethical prosecutors from exploiting the ignorance and racism of juries on the matter as the innocence project has shown many of innocent people especially black men have been executed or imprisoned for decades on such evidence if evidence with such poor track record is your standard then ill leave you to your inferiority the ignorance is breathtaking indeed if you think testimony itself is enough to prove anything you can look forward to a bright future as a juror its pretty well known that if you call a black person a nigger or a gay person a faggot its very likely to make them upset ive known plenty of black people and gays that just shrugged such insults off as the whining of intolerant bigots not worth their time that said being upset doesnt constitute

also important to remember that a view isnt wrong or without evidence just because you personally disagree with it youre kind of committing the very sin that annoys you here the radical religious argument against same sex marriage i am not extremely familiar with the fundamentalist marriage argument but from what i understand it comes from an interpretation of the bible thats not strictly opinion thats a nuanced reading of scripture many readings of scripture exist but all are logically reasoned from set assumptions that makes them more theories than opinions whether you think scripture or religion are valid reasons to hold a view is outside the scope of this argument the obama birth certificate scandal where was the opinion on this one people thought he was born in kenya turned out he wasnt people who think otherwise are misinformed which is not the same as holding an opinion reading your other examples it seems that you lump everything you perceive to be logically

many people being told youre being too sensitive feels like their issue and voice is being trivialized to give an extreme example if you were raped and when you spoke up about how you were feeling and were told youre being too sensitive i imagine youd feel very hurt and dismissed where as if you were told im really sorry that happened to you lets try to move past it together youd feel more supported and positive about the whole thing the underlying message is basically the same you cant do anything about the fact you were raped and can only move on with your life but the tone and message that you actually receives ends up very different and since youre being too sensitive is a very simplistic and reductionist phrasing it will effectively always lose any of that important

the key here though is that almost everyone was that way we didnt come up with our morals today out of nowhere we learned them from people around us the question isnt am i a better person than someone from the s but would i have been any better if id grown up then judging them for being morally backwards because they were racist sexist and so on is a little bit like judging them for being technologically backwards because they hadnt invented the internet yet that isnt to say we can or should ignore the actual evils of the time and frankly some of the people in the past held views that were backwards or abhorrent even for their time and society and perhaps we might judge them for that but on the whole its not particularly fair to judge a historical figure for what would be a moral failing in a modern person if we were to judge them at all it would be for the positions and beliefs they took on what were the leading moral debates of their time someone from the s probably shouldnt be judged for racism when everything in society told them they should be racist but it would be fair to ask where they stood on slavery\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 896\n","comment: your brother is

parroting what the opposition does in reverse obviously for publicity as well as effect only talking about the extremists what global warming and climate change are literally the same thing global warming and climate change are literally not the same thing even according to those scientists in the pocket or not they represent entirely different ideas and are almost contradictory to each other in inclination climate change is merely a broader spectrum term to explain the potential of global warming climate change as an ideal sometimes supposedly explains why some places are colder as a result of both natural and manmade climate change because obviously the entire globe can not warm if places get colder you can not have global warming be a thing while climate change explains why things also get colder hence why it is contradictory again why its difficult to take it seriously when they can not seem to get their own stuff straight they are related but not the same one may include the other but it does not mean they are the same global warming may be a causephenomena of climate change but it isnt in itself climate change literally yourassumed community dropped oneas it

scary enough to be a sensationalized idea i think youre generalizing about people not accepting truths that negatively affect them people will believe anything if theyre told it over and over again or if enough people believe it already or maybe people accept global warming because theyre concerned about the wellbeing of the planet and are taking a better safe than sorry approach touche on that youre right humans certainly can believe some silly things especially when crowd mentality kicks in vaccinationautism hysteria comes to mind i think where the distinction is made for climate change is the overwhelming scientific consensus i know its annoying to keep hearing that over and over science is hard to understand and many people are not scientifically literate enough to be shown graphsdatatrendsclimate models and make unbiased conclusions based off of them especially in the span of a minute news report i think thats why scientists have resorted by and large to saying were experts just believe us its not baloney though a little understanding of science an open mind and a google search will reveal the evidence they draw their conclusions on and it is very compelling in the end youre right that it isnt black and white its not a case of were gon na be totally fine and can keep doing what were doing vs the world is heading towards an apocalypse that will wipe us all

a trend line and everything of the atmospheres ability to retain water vapor which is positively correlated with an increase in mean temperature literally every piece of pristine data that you cited shows an increase in temperature over the last decade you just need to accept the fact that you are wrong about this and move on you screwed up and cited a source that doesnt support your claims its

lower bounds here we cant retain more than we produce im a bit confused about what you are saying here we are not producing energy that is affecting the climate the problem is that we are producing gasses co and ch which make earth absorb more energy from the sun see page of thishttpwwwsandiagovjytsaosolarfaqspdf for the a rough estimate of the total amount of energy striking the earths surface from the sun from that you can see the amount of energy humans produce is pitiful the way we have an impact on global temperature is by making earth keep more of that total sunlight as for the amount of energy it takes to increase the surface temperature of earth by deg im really not sure this is the kind of thing you would have to read papers to extract but it is kind of unimportant for our purposes if you want to make predictions then it is important the primary problem is that by making earth better at holding onto the suns energy we have offset the equilibrium in the direction of heating by a significant amount earth will continue to increase in temperature until it reaches the new equilibrium even if that new equilibrium is only slightly higher than the temp is now it will have a lot of damaging effects i would also like to say that my example in the last comment is wildly inaccurate and just there to make a point earth should emit roughly the same amount as it absorbs otherwise we would see the temperature change very quickly the ratio of emitabsorb should be very close to but not exactly at as there are other sources and our avg temp is changing just very slowly

death then frankly youre an idiot and youre also an idiot if youre incapable of seeing why we should outlaw activities that are deadly to humans thats exactly why we should outlaw them because theyre deadly to humans driving a car or playing football isnt as these both have incredibly low rates of death duelling to the death has an incredibly high rate of death and youll find very few other activities short of actively killing yourself that also have such a high rate of death you seemed to have ignored every other point i made relating to consent and being coerced into these activities and focused on the argument about whether or not deadly activities should be outlawed the point is that if you were to allow duelling to the death poor people might very well be coerced into duelling

you doing more and sometimes doing less but do you not this kind of identity is the reason civil rights struggles were waged for in the first place if one insists on sticking to a racial identity it is definitely problematic your actions might have more of an influence on the people around you instead of other people in your race for example perhaps you ought to be more concerned about their behaviour instead of the behaviour of other black people at an extreme this sort of closed identity can go down to your street or your building as well but it has the flipside of excluding those outside of it i might be a bit meandering here but imagine that black people did tip more than the average or that you were white do you think you ought to give up on the idea of making amends for

others over the past hours in particular weve seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension twitter banned milo for inciting this abuse something that he quite clearly never did you failed to show that this is

that our military is weak and depleted what is of the navys strike fighters arent ready for use but the air force has twice as many fighters as it did years ago what if we made improvements in other

nonfactor the single largest strategic problem with going to war with another country is gone states that dont have to worry about their interests being nuked are much more likely to send the ground

fit to do all jobs they will be assigned to the jobs that they can do well at on point cos you have to prove your co status this has always been true access to info will only make people more ready

permitted to use under what circumstance fuck your klan cracker\n","label: ah\n","\n","id: 1215\n","comment: i cant find anything saying that the officers were police officers if they were tsos they are not police and are not authorised to make arrests or use force in order to perform their duties if it is indeed the case that the security officials were transportation security officials then it is not illegal to resist their application of force as they are not authorised to do so in the first place additionally the man would be justified in resisting this application of force by unqualified and unauthorised officers if it is the case that the officers were police officers then your point still stands even if the officers were police officers we should first ask if the officers responded appropriately before we push the blame solely onto the passenger if it is the case that the officers responded disproportionately out of protocol or in escalation then the officers are also held partially accountable for any injury resulting from their actions as an extreme example to illustrate the point if an officer began to beat someone for jaywalking with a baton even if the jaywalker resisted the beating the officer is still held responsible for a portion of the injury\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 1216\n","comment: it sounds like your problem lies more with who you are as a

power into an ever smaller group of people and worse is doing so in an entirely subjective manner itd be one thing if your criteria were objective eg college degree x years of military service etc but youre basically allowing individuals to make an entirely subjective judgement as to who gets to vote or not and then pretending they wont abuse that power to reduce the risks of this you could interview those people not by a single person but a small jury and who gets to decide the jury not to mention now youve made the administration of the problem worse since now you have to get an entire jury of people together to decide to gets to vote and trying to get that system to work across an eligible base of around million people first i was thinking of france so now youre moving the goalposts but you still have around million eligible voters to deal with and you seriously want to do this for every single issue thats not national security related are you nuts of course it would be

with literal blasphemy laws but those dont seem to be what you are talking about it is not illegal to criticize religion you can rip into the doctrine of christianity islam or judaism all day every day and never trip an alarm what does is when it reaches the point of promoting hatred of practitioners as a whole that is a very high bar to meet one you basically have to be trying to meet you can not say that all muslims are violent rapists the problem with hate speech is that it is a type of speech that actively intimidates people away from engaging in both the discourse and in society as a whole its an intimidation tactic one that actively poisons discourse and has a chilling effect on speech as a whole who is going to risk open debate with groups that imply nothing short of hatred is justified freedom of speech needs to consider the reasonable effects of speech and allow for the fact that some speech is objectively harmful that is why threats are not protected speech\n","label:

the goal posts in my original comment i said pretty explicitly that the nword rose out of slavery which is part of what makes it particularly bad cracker is rude to say too but the reason its not as bad is that it doesnt remind white people of how their grandparents were whipped beaten and raped by human owners thats what the nword does theres a fairly large ethical difference there yes different slurs have different histories so yes they have different levels of hate shock value and stigma attached to them the us slave trade is one of the largest if not the largest in us history lasting a very long time and with a catastrophic human cost in terms of number of people kidnapped murdered or made to suffer so a word associated with it naturally has more anguish associated with it than cracker which isnt a polite word but isnt literally rooted in a time when white people were sold for profit anyway as i said part of my argument is you shouldnt say slurs in general i dont understand

other peoples money as selfish im not right leaning myself but i imagine the right see things like tax and expensive publicly funded social programs as what gets in the way of people having more money and doing better for themselves setting conditions to create more jobs and allowing people to work for their money in their goal i dont think in general the right want to see the world burn and screw

myself not all life to i only have to care about myself if we can agree that utility is the mist important thing than why dont we want to maximize it as much as possible you say if helping other people also helps you and only if it helps you will you do it i agree that is every persons imperative because everyone wants to maximize their personal happiness however i disagree that it is the moral thing to do i say that doing the action that maximizes utility for all beings is the moral action and understand that is a different action than what people will actually do one thing which i dont understand is what moral imperative is as i understand it it means the action one is compelled to do based on what is right but the context you put it in makes it sound like moral responsibility

other form we can use these cameras to our advantage against crime with the common citizen and the police people who against this may argue that its invasion of privacy but theyre working almost all

children we have and when after all thats why we use birth control and vaccinate children there is no logical point to giving birth to someone who wont even get to live enough to mature as for

truth you dont have to believe in a literal account of historical myths in order to fit into your culture the vast majority of christians dont literally believe the world was created in days and i suspect the same is true of jews the historical figure of jesus who was likely a real person whether you believe in the divine miracles etc that christians claim he performed or not was almost certainly not born on th december indeed he was likely born in summer or early spring and yet that is when christians celebrate christmas it doesnt change the significance of their holiday that the reason behind it is factually incorrect the same is true of passover its a good holiday with a good message behind it even if the reasons that it is celebrated are historically inaccurate personally i

ethical change take all the different kinds of christianity we have today protestantism catholicism orthodox and tell me that they all sport exactly the same unchanged morals thats right they dont over hundreds of years many different churches and groups have interpreted religion in their own way and then turned that into some form of moral structure although it may not have always been for the better it was change why did some saxon tribe go from ceremonial war dances to reciting the lords prayer before battle because religion changed how they behaved and then it continued to change them after that take john ball as a specific example of how religion can promote moral growth he lived in a time at which feudalism was still around where the king was supposedly chosen by divine right and a large quantity of the population were essentially slaves what did he do to fight these injustices he called upon the bible of course stating that no man had the right to elevate him self where in the eyes of god we were all created equal see frossiarts chronicles or herehttpenwikipediaorgwikijohnballpriest for more info ball was not the only one who sought to change ethics through religion though look at wycliffe the diggers or anyone who challenged their contemporary systems in the name of their gods also the thing about getting stuck in religious texts is a bit silly churchesgroups have always interpreted holy books in their own way which is why we have so many different sects of each religion lastly i agree that basing your morals on year old books is a bit odd but at the same time you can find some pretty compassionate teachings in various religious scriptures a lot of the bible for example preaches concepts which are very similar to socialism a theory that continues to be

explain why and how let alone teach someone how to avoid it offensiveness is a nebulous and subjective thing there is also something to be said about backing up claims with evidence when applicable again in majority of cases there is no hard evidence because offensiveness is subjective cultural and depends on the emotions of the people involved so in the end the offended person can just

curve she would understand what i mean that its difficult to begin to learn if i said there was a shallow learning curve she would likely either assume the opposite or simply be more confused my basic

he could have a better life but the existence of a better life does not necessarily mean his life is bad this is my main point he was a rescue dog he needed a home or he would spend the rest of his probably short life in a kennel at the pound he is much happier with us than what his fate would be if he was not adopted now he might have had a better household adopt him my counter to this is a household goes out expressly to adopt a dog they then adopt approximately the number of dogs they intended to get from the beginning this means if a better household adopted my dog they would not have adopted what ever dog they actually wound up with so there would still be a dog in a kennel waiting for a home or death edit decided to add more in something to think about how exciting is your life while you are at work if you have a cubicle job like many people than you have less room then your dog does how good a life do we need to provide for our pets that is so much higher then our own life would you tell people they should not live their lives because they can only do fun things for a few hours every day why is a dogs life so much different dont forget what the alternative is for

the future of gaming have you heard of the publisher paradox interactive they are probably the main reason i have faith in the future of gaming and other minor publishers and indie devs and the reasons i like them is probably also the reason they have grown a whole lot more popular in the past few years those reason being they have great communication with the community and they have a usually great dlc policy especially compared to other publishers as far as im care their games always feel complete upon release and whenever they release a dlc it is accompanied by a fair bit of free content which benefits everyone even years after release yeah they do some bullshit things to with their cosmetic dlc but at least that doesnt effect the gameplay i also have high hopes for some more popular franchises like fallout last time when skyrim came out the preorder bonus was an out of game map the dlcs also seemed reasonable and complete and so far then have done nothing to show that f will be any different anyways i have only bought one or two aaa title in the past two or so years primarily because of the reasons you have mentioned its a sad problem and will probably always be around but it will never be everywhere if people like you give your money to developers who arent sleazy but there are so many other great games out there right now that focusing on a handful of

to your detriment i actually opened and read the link you gave hq is still simply wrong and a loser for lying about it and derailing the whole debate into his little tirade “ free will ” is a philosophical term of art for a particular sort of capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives which is exactly the definition i used that hq said was wrong this stands true for all the subsequent forms of free will that follow for each variety of determinism there are philosophers who i deny its reality either because of the existence of free will or on independent grounds ii accept its reality but argue for its compatibility with free will or iii accept its reality and deny its compatibility with free will with this the entry introduces at least different versions of free will all of which contain my initial definition and out of which the one the op gave as the gods true definition is only one of its actually you who have have have forfeited the argument by moving away from the issue at hand going into a rant on the metadiscussion and claiming some sort of accusation of malintent here in the presence of a perfectly reasonable response wrong this whole thing started with hq claiming the ops definition of free will was wrong and subsequently doing it to me as well despite my definition being the common one that is included in all of the other versions later hq forced me to pick a subpath which still doesnt change the fact that what i said is a part of all the versions and what he said is only a part of one of them that

same person as the rest of this comment thread but this one response stands out to me it just seems like we just take one of the definitions to be the more prominent definition this is an inherent problem of language take for example the sentence the bartenders punch was quite strong if i said this to you there are two completely valid assumptions the first that the bartender has struck with their fist someone or something near the speaker the second that the bartender mixes a highly alcoholic drink in the argument here you say being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is moral grandstanding then when someone offers you a definition of the possibly unconditional acceptance of tolerance you explain that your own definition is the one you are choosing to take but you are not in a position to make that statement as you are not the original speaker or one who identifies with the statement it is equivalent to use the previous example of saying the bartenders punch is strong and you arguing that the bartender is wrong for hitting things when the original speaker was just talking about their beverage once clarification of language is offered you do not have the ability to argue that another definition was originally being used because it has been clarified if the person you are arguing with is using b to accept despite this direction would be a valid counterargument but they arent so the counterargument of i choose to use another definition despite your clarification in order to maintain my previously held views falls a bit flat in many ways the statement being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is an argumentatively unclear statement but its repetition has likely seen the increase of its use\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 1654\n","comment: please if you

the alternative case in order to test for anything you need a hypothesis if you try to make observations based on what seems out of the ordinary your conclusions will always be subjective in more formal statistical terms there is no way to test a statistical test to make sure that its the right test or if there is there is no way to do so for that test ad infinitum you will always end up making assumptions based on your platonic ideal for instance suppose the average of some series seems out of the ordinary relative to its comparables well how do you know that taking the average was the right thing some series dont have a stable average because their outliers are so extreme in real life you will never get to take the limit as the sample size approaches infinity for obvious reasons you will simply have to make a subjective judgement as to when you have seen enough the idea of a series with a stable average is a nice platonic ideal it may not entirely correspond to

were retroactively marked as classified by the state department including emails deemed secret and deemed top secret government policy reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information should be considered and handled as classified even if not marked as such so the issue is whether or not she should have known that

programs promoting women in early stem career paths he is arguing that the representation of certain groups in these fields as it is today is optimal this is not supported by evidence that this is a touchy subject as much as we might like this to be about pure science you are dealing with things that affect people personally an unsolicited document was bound to create backlash no matter how well sourced i dont work at google im at a different major but i assume that google is something like my company where there are diversity programs that are absolutely looking for input and help from employees he could have gone to these people and hashed out ideas with experts perhaps this wouldnt have worked but it certainly wouldnt have caused a shitstorm when you need to fire up the pr machine to handle a situation like this your contribution to the company starts to look like a net negative really really quickly while the shitstorm was very clearly kicked up by it being published externally it seems like there was an internal shitstorm happening before even that happened all that said threats of violence against this man are obviously outrageously unacceptable\n","label:

and npr along with reddit and some random other content i dont think the public is apathetic though i think its a more complicated situation of burnout over too many things to be outraged or concerned about so they limit their concerns to high priority andor personally affecting issues i can grant that this is just a personal assessment based on limited information but still considering the media attention given to issues thatre well less than valid at this point imho theres plenty of space for mens rights to fill should we get past some of the frankly absurd and pointless things that capture the attention of the general public at any given moment im not saying thats an easy thing to achieve but not impossible either could i see some examples where this happened for an issue at least similar in scale to a mens issue like male suicide well take the nra somewhere between of the public supports universal background checks the nra has its grips on a highly politically active and important subsection of the population such that it has maintained high levels of political power and importance despite being very small numerically many people dont care either way but as a person whos sold guns at a department store i can tell you that theres an intense minority that flips out about anything gun related and theyre highly effective in politics partly due to being present in swing states in substantial numbers but thats a whole other side issue i guess\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 1916\n","comment: not true now you are going at speed limit and you see a car frantically

cut himself at the saw and is bleeding out at alarming speed and he begs you with tears in his eyes to let him through i dont give a fuck if there is an emergency than you know what that guy should have done called a fucking ambulance instead you think i should let someone who shouldnt be driving in the first place continue to be a danger to everyone else what about the next driver who panics because of the honking and flashing and gets into an accident your example is fucking retarded and only bolsters ops point your assumption just cost someones life and that is why you should not block

having a diabetic attack or a tree surgeon bleeding to death in any case letting them past you doesnt affect you in any way and may save a life these scenarios arent likely but they also arent

even if its a thing that can totally happen and happens all the time even if you lend another friend money and they dont pay you back either why are you at fault for just trying to help your friends

are taken all the time its become a part of our culture there are jerks in the fold who misuse their lovers trust the onus shouldnt be on the sender to be distrusting of everyone we should try to

their bank accounts harassing people walking down the street whatever spreading nudes without another persons permission is at more or less the same level of crappiness and anyone who falls victim to

cant think for yourself you have to believe those who imprison you how many people does your capitalist owned state kill or imprison or refuse to educate\n","label: ah\n","\n","id: 1991\n","comment: whether you believe in god or not everything that happens to you in life cant be calculated with cold precision at some point you will need to commit to doing something you are afraid you wont be able to do you will have to put your trust in something or someone you arent sure you can trust people commonly marry and raise children and both undertakings are fraught with uncertainty a religious background can help people take on things that are larger and more complicated than they are capable of understanding younger people are often dismayed when they discover they were raised by people who are apparently delusional they become like plato searching for the wisest of all men the truth is no one has all the answers everyone is winging it to some extent the ability to wing it is a very useful skill its not inherently harmful for people to believe in a benevolent god whether he exists or not but for younger people it looks like a dead end because it clearly ends in a state of
