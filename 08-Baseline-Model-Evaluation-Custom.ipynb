hope those persons have good intentions sadly every system is based on this and what youre missing is that your system increases the risk of this but consolidating voting power into an ever smaller group of people and worse is doing so in an entirely subjective manner itd be one thing if your criteria were objective eg college degree x years of military service etc but youre basically allowing individuals to make an entirely subjective judgement as to who gets to vote or not and then pretending they wont abuse that power to reduce the risks of this you could interview those people not by a single person but a small jury and who gets to decide the jury not to mention now youve made the administration of the problem worse since now you have to get an entire jury of people together to decide to gets to vote and trying to get that system to work across an eligible base of around million people first i was thinking of france so now youre moving the goalposts but you still have around million eligible voters to deal with and you seriously want to do this for every single issue thats not national security related are you nuts of course it would be a massive process but i dont think its impossible and what if its for the best of our nation and who gets to decide whats in the best interest of the nation if not the nation itself as an aside i find it hilarious that youve so smugly

also subject to change like a normal law or do they require the extra effort of a constitutional amendment goes to a popular vote and needs a margin to pass this personally seems like a terrible idea you can get of the population to agree on almost anything if they are scared or misinformed enough the constitution protects us against making panicked decisions that undermine the entire backbone of our country being as this is a year cycle i dont think it would be unreasonable for this process to take a year or more i think youre being optimistic about how much time money and confusion it would cost to rewrite all of federal law in the face of a new constitution every legal decision would have to be revisited things like brown vs board of education or roe vs wade would no longer be valid legal opinions this is an underhanded way to eliminate legal restrictions on things a special interest group might want dissolved without actually having to make people think directly about that thing like if you are playing chess and you fork an opponents piece the piece youre directly threatening isnt the one youre going after and you leave them no choice sometimes but to accept the loss this is

in wanting a border wall means youre an immigrant hating xenophobe did trump say some nasty shit about mexicans sure does that mean everyone who agrees with the need for border security is a bigot no so why is that the common view among liberals today the problem is as others have pointed out is using that line of thought is more likely to get s of people outraged and motivated but thats a good

or kill bacteria i think this is the same idea you were going for so wont spend a lot of time on it next i dont understand how you go from i am only myself not all life to i only have to care about myself if we can agree that utility is the mist important thing than why dont we want to maximize it as much as possible you say if helping other people also helps you and only if it helps you will you do it i agree that is every persons imperative because everyone wants to maximize their personal happiness however i disagree that it is the moral thing to do i say that doing the action that maximizes utility for all beings is the moral action and understand that is a different action than what people will actually do one thing which i dont understand is what moral imperative is as i understand it it means the action one is compelled to do based on what is right but the context you put it in makes it sound like moral responsibility what is the difference if it is responsibility i

a mistake was made then they wouldnt be worth trusting on top of that the temperature pause was weather not climate those are not the same thing thats irrelevant we created those models using greenhouse gases trapped in trees and ice the industrial revolution gave us that information by increasing the amount big greenhouse gases in the atmosphere yep thats why it took nearly years to prove

remains that there is no historical evidence for hebrews in egypt how the myth started im not going to guess its not a doltish claim that some random redditor is making its historical consensus its not even hard to find jewish people that can admit this truth you dont have to believe in a literal account of historical myths in order to fit into your culture the vast majority of christians dont literally believe the world was created in days and i suspect the same is true of jews the historical figure of jesus who was likely a real person whether you believe in the divine miracles etc that christians claim he performed or not was almost certainly not born on th december indeed he was likely born in summer or early spring and yet that is when christians celebrate christmas it doesnt change the significance of their holiday that the reason behind it is factually incorrect the same is true of passover its a good holiday with a good message behind it even if the reasons that it is celebrated are historically inaccurate personally i choose to believe the historians and archeologists who are trained in this kind of thing and know what theyre doing rather than cultural tradition

catholicism orthodox and tell me that they all sport exactly the same unchanged morals thats right they dont over hundreds of years many different churches and groups have interpreted religion in their own way and then turned that into some form of moral structure although it may not have always been for the better it was change why did some saxon tribe go from ceremonial war dances to reciting the lords prayer before battle because religion changed how they behaved and then it continued to change them after that take john ball as a specific example of how religion can promote moral growth he lived in a time at which feudalism was still around where the king was supposedly chosen by divine right and a large quantity of the population were essentially slaves what did he do to fight these injustices he called upon the bible of course stating that no man had the right to elevate him self where in the eyes of god we were all created equal see frossiarts chronicles or herehttpenwikipediaorgwikijohnballpriest for more info ball was not the only one who sought to change ethics through religion though look at wycliffe the diggers or anyone who challenged their contemporary systems in the name of their gods also the thing about getting stuck in religious texts is a bit silly churchesgroups have always interpreted holy books in their own way which is why we have so many different sects of each religion lastly i agree that basing your morals on year old books is a bit odd but at the same time you can find some pretty compassionate teachings in various religious scriptures a lot of the bible for example preaches concepts which are very similar to socialism a theory that continues to be relevant today\n","label: none\n","\n","{'bert': 'none', 'cnn':

understand it then by what metric can we say that the language used was incorrect if a friend were to ask me how difficult it is to learn a certain skill and i told her that theres a steep learning curve she would understand what i mean that its difficult to begin to learn if i said there was a shallow learning curve she would likely either assume the opposite or simply be more confused my basic point here is this the fact that language changes over time doesnt necessarily make newer linguistic constructions incorrect many words and phrases we now use daily and consider to be perfect english are corrupted or bastardized forms of older words or phrases the only reason that these are considered more correct is the perception of their age\n","label: none\n","\n","{'bert': 'none', 'cnn':

a better life but the existence of a better life does not necessarily mean his life is bad this is my main point he was a rescue dog he needed a home or he would spend the rest of his probably short life in a kennel at the pound he is much happier with us than what his fate would be if he was not adopted now he might have had a better household adopt him my counter to this is a household goes out expressly to adopt a dog they then adopt approximately the number of dogs they intended to get from the beginning this means if a better household adopted my dog they would not have adopted what ever dog they actually wound up with so there would still be a dog in a kennel waiting for a home or death edit decided to add more in something to think about how exciting is your life while you are at work if you have a cubicle job like many people than you have less room then your dog does how good a life do we need to provide for our pets that is so much higher then our own life would you tell

but defiantly not every publisher nor will it fully ruin the future of gaming have you heard of the publisher paradox interactive they are probably the main reason i have faith in the future of gaming and other minor publishers and indie devs and the reasons i like them is probably also the reason they have grown a whole lot more popular in the past few years those reason being they have great communication with the community and they have a usually great dlc policy especially compared to other publishers as far as im care their games always feel complete upon release and whenever they release a dlc it is accompanied by a fair bit of free content which benefits everyone even years after release yeah they do some bullshit things to with their cosmetic dlc but at least that doesnt effect the gameplay i also have high hopes for some more popular franchises like fallout last time when skyrim came out the preorder bonus was an out of game map the dlcs also seemed reasonable and complete and so far then have done nothing to show that f will be any different anyways i have only bought one or two aaa title in the past two or so years primarily because of the reasons you have mentioned its a sad problem and will probably always be around but it will never be everywhere if people like you give your money to developers who arent sleazy but there are so many other great games

is exactly the definition i used that hq said was wrong this stands true for all the subsequent forms of free will that follow for each variety of determinism there are philosophers who i deny its reality either because of the existence of free will or on independent grounds ii accept its reality but argue for its compatibility with free will or iii accept its reality and deny its compatibility with free will with this the entry introduces at least different versions of free will all of which contain my initial definition and out of which the one the op gave as the gods true definition is only one of its actually you who have have have forfeited the argument by moving away from the issue at hand going into a rant on the metadiscussion and claiming some sort of accusation of malintent here in the presence of a perfectly reasonable response wrong this whole thing started with hq claiming the ops definition of free will was wrong and subsequently doing it to me as well despite my definition being the common one that is included in all of the other versions later hq forced me to pick a subpath which still doesnt change the fact that what i said is a part of all the versions and

this comment thread but this one response stands out to me it just seems like we just take one of the definitions to be the more prominent definition this is an inherent problem of language take for example the sentence the bartenders punch was quite strong if i said this to you there are two completely valid assumptions the first that the bartender has struck with their fist someone or something near the speaker the second that the bartender mixes a highly alcoholic drink in the argument here you say being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is moral grandstanding then when someone offers you a definition of the possibly unconditional acceptance of tolerance you explain that your own definition is the one you are choosing to take but you are not in a position to make that statement as you are not the original speaker or one who identifies with the statement it is equivalent to use the previous example of saying the bartenders punch is strong and you arguing that the bartender is wrong for hitting things when the original speaker was just talking about their beverage once clarification of language is offered you do not have the ability to argue that another definition was originally being used because it has been clarified if the person you are arguing with is using b to accept despite this direction would be a valid counterargument but they arent so the counterargument of i choose to use another definition despite your clarification in order to maintain my previously held views falls a bit flat in many ways the statement being tolerant of everyone

always end up making assumptions based on your platonic ideal for instance suppose the average of some series seems out of the ordinary relative to its comparables well how do you know that taking the average was the right thing some series dont have a stable average because their outliers are so extreme in real life you will never get to take the limit as the sample size approaches infinity for obvious reasons you will simply have to make a subjective judgement as to when you have seen enough the idea of a series with a stable average is a nice platonic ideal it may not entirely correspond

violated state department protocols and procedures as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping in response clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and state department regulations and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts the issue is that the emails were retroactively classified as sensitive information up to secret and top secret however nearly emails on the server were retroactively marked as classified by the state department including emails deemed secret and deemed top secret government policy reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information should be considered and handled as classified even if not marked as such so the issue is whether or not she should have known that the classified secret or top secret information in particular should have been on a private email server also one

the right ratio nowif youre goal were to have a certain amount of cream and to hell with the ratio thenby all means your method is correct additionally the cream first method that attempts to deliver on the perfect ratio might work in a coffee cup you have all the time but if you are as many are in coffee shops frequently or at friends house the only way to really control the situation is to add cream to your coffee until its the right ratio you simply cant do cream first in a place like starbucks or any other place that serves the coffee for you and in friends house you cant be in touch with the size of the mug so as to be sure that youve got enough room to coffeeyourcream to the right ratio lastly heaven forbid that you find yourself with percent or skim milk its own sort of tragedy here

it has maintained high levels of political power and importance despite being very small numerically many people dont care either way but as a person whos sold guns at a department store i can tell

hope those persons have good intentions sadly every system is based on this and what youre missing is that your system increases the risk of this but consolidating voting power into an ever smaller group of people and worse is doing so in an entirely subjective manner itd be one thing if your criteria were objective eg college degree x years of military service etc but youre basically allowing individuals to make an entirely subjective judgement as to who gets to vote or not and then pretending they wont abuse that power to reduce the risks of this you could interview those people not by a single person but a small jury and who gets to decide the jury not to mention now youve made the administration of the problem worse since now you have to get an entire jury of people together to decide to gets to vote and trying to get that system to work across an eligible base of around million people first i was thinking of france so now youre moving the goalposts but you still have around million eligible voters to deal with and you seriously want to do this for every single issue thats not national security related are you nuts of course it would be a massive process but i dont think its impossible and what if its for the best of our nation and who gets to decide whats in the best interest of the nation if not the nation itself as an aside i find it hilarious that youve so smugly

these who gets to write them are they also subject to change like a normal law or do they require the extra effort of a constitutional amendment goes to a popular vote and needs a margin to pass this personally seems like a terrible idea you can get of the population to agree on almost anything if they are scared or misinformed enough the constitution protects us against making panicked decisions that undermine the entire backbone of our country being as this is a year cycle i dont think it would be unreasonable for this process to take a year or more i think youre being optimistic about how much time money and confusion it would cost to rewrite all of federal law in the face of a new constitution every legal decision would have to be revisited things like brown vs board of education or roe vs wade would no longer be valid legal opinions this is an underhanded way to eliminate legal restrictions on things a special interest group might want dissolved without actually having to make people think directly about that thing like if you are playing chess and you fork an opponents piece the piece youre directly threatening isnt the one youre going after and you leave them no choice sometimes but to accept the loss this is a dangerous power to give politicians in an age where disinformation and noisetosignal ratio are at an all time high though in fairness thats exactly what happened the first time we got lucky that the document was written during a time when those people in charge had just fought a long bloody war specifically against tyranny this is reflected in its

the trouble vs keeping it a hobby many people pursue a romantic career only to find what people actually pay them for is the really boring parts of it and not the more creative work theyd hoped theyd be doing i dont think its wrong to be concerned about people spending tons of money on this just that its too extreme to say people shouldnt major in these fields fewer people should major in them

today the problem is as others have pointed out is using that line of thought is more likely to get s of people outraged and motivated but thats a good thing you say people should be involved sure people should be involved but they should also understand what they are involved in not blindly follow the stereotype that republicans are evil because they want to split up families and send children

is the same idea you were going for so wont spend a lot of time on it next i dont understand how you go from i am only myself not all life to i only have to care about myself if we can agree that utility is the mist important thing than why dont we want to maximize it as much as possible you say if helping other people also helps you and only if it helps you will you do it i agree that is every persons imperative because everyone wants to maximize their personal happiness however i disagree that it is the moral thing to do i say that doing the action that maximizes utility for all beings is the moral action and understand that is a different action than what people will actually do one thing which i dont understand is what moral imperative is as i understand it it means the

about a century and isnt likely to go anywhere anytime soon lastly no it doesnt clear anything up cause aint nothing foggy there are no realistic circumstances in which a native speaker would honestly become confused by these dual meanings the context and sentence structures for each usage is vastly different have you ever been confused by this apparently vexing but completely non existent

historical consensus its not even hard to find jewish people that can admit this truth you dont have to believe in a literal account of historical myths in order to fit into your culture the vast majority of christians dont literally believe the world was created in days and i suspect the same is true of jews the historical figure of jesus who was likely a real person whether you believe in the divine miracles etc that christians claim he performed or not was almost certainly not born on th december indeed he was likely born in summer or early spring and yet that is when christians celebrate christmas it doesnt change the significance of their holiday that the reason behind it is factually incorrect the same is true of passover its a good holiday with a good message behind it

christianity we have today protestantism catholicism orthodox and tell me that they all sport exactly the same unchanged morals thats right they dont over hundreds of years many different churches and groups have interpreted religion in their own way and then turned that into some form of moral structure although it may not have always been for the better it was change why did some saxon tribe go from ceremonial war dances to reciting the lords prayer before battle because religion changed how they behaved and then it continued to change them after that take john ball as a specific example of how religion can promote moral growth he lived in a time at which feudalism was still around where the king was supposedly chosen by divine right and a large quantity of the population were essentially slaves what did he do to fight these injustices he called upon the bible of course stating that no man had the right to elevate him self where in the eyes of god we were all created equal see frossiarts chronicles or herehttpenwikipediaorgwikijohnballpriest for more info ball was not the only one who sought to change ethics through religion though look at wycliffe the diggers or anyone who challenged their contemporary systems in the name of their gods also the thing about getting stuck in religious texts is a bit silly churchesgroups have always interpreted holy books in their own way which is why we have so many different sects of each religion lastly i agree that basing your morals on year old books is a bit odd but at the same time you can find some pretty compassionate teachings in various religious scriptures a lot of the bible for example preaches concepts which are very similar to socialism a theory that continues to be relevant today\n","label:

to be said about backing up claims with evidence when applicable again in majority of cases there is no hard evidence because offensiveness is subjective cultural and depends on the emotions of the

saying is absolutely ridiculous let me try to break this down for you you are claiming that every pet which is left home alone during the work day is suffering a silent and completely invisible form of ptsd that only you are qualified to diagnose you claim that abused animals will still wag their tails at their owners so how are you able to measure this distress in any quantifiable way have you brought up this amateur theory with any veterinarians do you think theyre likely to concede that leaving a dog alone for hours constitutes abuse do you know what my dog does when im not at home he flips on his back and sleeps he does this until i get home and then we go for a walk at some point he eats dog food and i give him a good pet this is his life and its a pretty great one compared to the life he would lead on the street or in the wild or euthanized in some shelter what youre saying is so completely ludicrous on its face that i cant believe you arent totally embarrased to even write it down for other people to see youre basically arguing that every dog in new york city with working owners is as of right now being abused if you really believe that you should call peta right

outside only when i take him on walks me and my wife work and he stays home alone if we work at the same time i agree with a fair amount of what you are saying he could have a better life but the existence of a better life does not necessarily mean his life is bad this is my main point he was a rescue dog he needed a home or he would spend the rest of his probably short life in a kennel at the pound he is much happier with us than what his fate would be if he was not adopted now he might have had a better household adopt him my counter to this is a household goes out expressly to adopt a dog they then adopt approximately the number of dogs they intended to get from the beginning this means if a better household adopted my dog they would not have adopted what ever dog they actually wound up with so there would still be a dog in a kennel waiting for a home or death edit decided to add more in something to think about how exciting is your life while you are at work if you have a cubicle job like many people than you have less room then your dog does how good a life do we need to provide for our pets that is so much higher then our own life would you tell people they should not live their lives because they can only do fun things for a few hours every day why is a dogs life so much different dont forget what the alternative is for current dogs in this predicament the only way to get them out is to kill them for future dogs you must answer this question is it better to be board while your humans are at work or not exist at all\n","label: none\n","\n","{'bert':

defiantly not every publisher nor will it fully ruin the future of gaming have you heard of the publisher paradox interactive they are probably the main reason i have faith in the future of gaming and other minor publishers and indie devs and the reasons i like them is probably also the reason they have grown a whole lot more popular in the past few years those reason being they have great communication with the community and they have a usually great dlc policy especially compared to other publishers as far as im care their games always feel complete upon release and whenever they release a dlc it is accompanied by a fair bit of free content which benefits everyone even years after release yeah they do some bullshit things to with their cosmetic dlc but at least that doesnt effect the gameplay i also have high hopes for some more popular franchises like fallout last time when skyrim came out the preorder bonus was an out of game map the dlcs also seemed reasonable and complete and so far then have done nothing to show that f will be any different anyways i have only bought one or two aaa title in the past two or so years primarily because of the reasons you have mentioned its a sad problem and will probably always be around but it will never be everywhere if people like you give your money to developers who arent sleazy but there are so many other great games

hq is still simply wrong and a loser for lying about it and derailing the whole debate into his little tirade “ free will ” is a philosophical term of art for a particular sort of capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives which is exactly the definition i used that hq said was wrong this stands true for all the subsequent forms of free will that follow for each variety of determinism there are philosophers who i deny its reality either because of the existence of free will or on independent grounds ii accept its reality but argue for its compatibility with free will or iii accept its reality and deny its compatibility with free will with this the entry introduces at least different versions of free will all of which contain my initial definition and out of which the one the op gave as the gods true definition is only one of its actually you who have have have forfeited the argument by moving away from the issue at hand going into a rant on the metadiscussion and claiming some sort of accusation of malintent here in the presence of a perfectly reasonable response wrong this whole thing started with hq claiming the ops definition of free will was wrong and subsequently doing it to me as well despite my definition being the common one that is included in all of the other versions later hq forced me to pick a subpath which still doesnt change the fact that what i said is a part of all the versions and what he said is only a part of one of them that is exactly what intellectual dishonesty is knowing something and still

the definitions to be the more prominent definition this is an inherent problem of language take for example the sentence the bartenders punch was quite strong if i said this to you there are two completely valid assumptions the first that the bartender has struck with their fist someone or something near the speaker the second that the bartender mixes a highly alcoholic drink in the argument here you say being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is moral grandstanding then when someone offers you a definition of the possibly unconditional acceptance of tolerance you explain that your own definition is the one you are choosing to take but you are not in a position to make that statement as you are not the original speaker or one who identifies with the statement it is equivalent to use the previous example of saying the bartenders punch is strong and you arguing that the bartender is wrong for hitting things when the original speaker was just talking about their beverage once clarification of language is offered you do not have the ability to argue that another definition was originally being used because it has been clarified if the person you are arguing with is using b to accept despite this direction would be a valid counterargument but they arent so the counterargument of i choose to use another definition despite your clarification in order to maintain my previously held views falls a bit flat in many ways the statement being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is an argumentatively unclear statement but its repetition has likely seen the increase

average because their outliers are so extreme in real life you will never get to take the limit as the sample size approaches infinity for obvious reasons you will simply have to make a subjective

youre discounting the nontrivial number of cases where the victim isnt even sure at the time whether or not they were raped that sounds weird but when youre talking about situations with consent

in response clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and state department regulations and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts the issue is that the emails were retroactively classified as sensitive information up to secret and top secret however nearly emails on the server were retroactively marked as classified by the state department including emails deemed secret and deemed top secret government policy reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information should be considered and handled as classified even if not marked as such so the issue is whether or not she should have known that the classified secret or top secret information in particular should have been on a private email server also one of the first and most important things they brief you in the military is the importance of handling classified information

constrained in how much coffee you can add to get the right ratio nowif youre goal were to have a certain amount of cream and to hell with the ratio thenby all means your method is correct additionally the cream first method that attempts to deliver on the perfect ratio might work in a coffee cup you have all the time but if you are as many are in coffee shops frequently or at friends house the only way to really control the situation is to add cream to your coffee until its the right ratio you simply cant do cream first in a place like starbucks or any other place that serves the coffee for you and in friends house you cant be in touch with the size of the mug so as to be sure that youve got enough room to coffeeyourcream to the right ratio lastly heaven forbid that you find

customer the obviously sizzling hotplate or the freshly brewed degree coffee is in fact hot and protecting them with a cloth or a coffee collar that is all to reduce liability in the case of an accident so let us explore what happens when people commonly dont wear shoes in your establishment you would either have to toestubproof your fixtures or you would have redesign your flow to reduce the number fixtures around your establishment to reduce the likelihood of said accidents so whats cheaper a sign that says wear shoes you nimrod or accepting that riskavoiding it through spending money i think thats a pretty logical one parasites eateries and other places that have hightraffic public movement things like hookworm are picked up trough infected soil so people will wear shoes wait in line and track in trace amounts of dirt and parasite eggs like hookworm if you walk around barefoot youre going to open yourself up to more threatvectors we wear shoes for a reason\n","label:
