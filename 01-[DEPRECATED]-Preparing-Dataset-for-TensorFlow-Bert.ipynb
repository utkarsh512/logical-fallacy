activity comes from a different motivation lets say that the same guy who is cheating on the test bullied me all through high school or cut me off in traffic on the way to the test or is just a real

anything with out evidence eventually evidence will be needed to prove guilt but you can still make an initial accusation heres the wiki on rape investigations httpenwikipediaorgwikirapeinvestigation and heres a page another page about the same httpswwwrainnorggetinformationaftermathofsexualassaultpreservingandcollectingforensicevidence now eventually the investigation will turn into a a said vs b said but you can say exactly the same thing about assault charges trespassing harassment or any other of the thousands of crimes that are primarily peer to peer in nature but because so often theres no evidence in a rape case its become acceptable for evidenceless accusations to be taken seriously please provide a citation that rape cases are abundantly prosecuted with absolutely no evidence heres a great example of this where a student is carrying around a mattress until their accused rapist is expelled httpwwwusatodaycomstorynewsnationnowemmasulkowitzcolumbiarapeperformanceart at that point what their doing has nothing to do with the legal system theyre just shaming the entire system until someone gives into their demands thats not how it works if theres not enough evidence to accuse someone of the crime if the court turns it down then you cant convict them period i agree that this is stupid slightly eye rollish but one needs to be cautious about drawing larger conclusions about complicated topics from the actions of the stupidestmost desperate person in the room\n","label: ah\n","\n","id: 783\n","comment: first of all sexual assault is punished severely these long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women and i rarely see anyone contesting these punishments it seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists first its not just about the rapist its about the victim also note that your statement only applies for a very specific subset of rape violent stranger rape anything other than violent rape becomes far harder to prosecute mainly because people tend to have a view that favors the rapist also when people offer advice regarding ways to avoid rape the rapist is still held culpable not always often the advice borders on doubting whether a rape even happened look at any girl assaulted while at a college party the rape culture which seeks to find what the woman did to deserve it gets in the way of the conviction or condemnation of the rapist probably not ive noticed that often when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future in fact when i lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago my entire family nagged me about how i should have kept it in a better pocket of course rape are thievery are different i completely acknowledge this however wheres the line between helpful advice and rape culture i think that some feminists confuse these two placing both of them in the realm of rape culture look there is a difference between victim blaming and honest advice giving the difference is when the tone shifts from how to prevent to you deserved it unfortunately the tone tends to be more on the latter camp\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 784\n","comment: so how do we make decisions based on science for example many states have laws that require vaccinations these laws were made by politicians who were elected by general public if general public remain ignorant about vaccines vaccines are science vast majority of people would then refuse vaccines because shots are painful and

the same as not having laws the laws in question exist only to achieve economic outcomes and breaking them is highly visible uber breaks them at their own risk and can be punished or fined they arent

quantifiable does that mean i dont get pleasure from reading books it means that we cant quantify or objectively prove that you get pleasure from reading books if testimony wasnt evidence why is testimony admitted as evidence in a courtroom testimony is used to supplement physical evidence cases where eyewitness testimony is the only evidence available are regarded as weak cases for a reason of course this hasnt kept unethical prosecutors from exploiting the ignorance and racism of juries on the matter as the innocence project has shown many of innocent people especially black men have been executed or imprisoned for decades on such evidence if evidence with such poor track record is your standard then ill leave you to your inferiority the ignorance is breathtaking indeed if you think testimony itself is enough to prove anything you can look forward to a bright future as a juror its pretty well known that if you call a black person a nigger or a gay person a faggot its very likely to make them upset ive known plenty of black people and gays that just shrugged such insults off as the whining of intolerant bigots not worth their time that said being upset doesnt constitute

argument against same sex marriage i am not extremely familiar with the fundamentalist marriage argument but from what i understand it comes from an interpretation of the bible thats not strictly opinion thats a nuanced reading of scripture many readings of scripture exist but all are logically reasoned from set assumptions that makes them more theories than opinions whether you think scripture or religion are valid reasons to hold a view is outside the scope of this argument the obama birth certificate scandal where was the opinion on this one people thought he was born in kenya turned out he wasnt people who think otherwise are misinformed which is not the same as holding an opinion reading your other examples it seems that you lump everything you perceive to be logically

httpwwwtodayscienceorgierarticlepaperid and here is an important excerpt findings reveal that elite institutions commonly group applicants into “ pools ” and that applications are compared within but

only a role that we perform but allegedly this social rule sticks with in every situation and is part of your identity i think its obviously hard for nonbinary gender to actually create from nothing

if you were told im really sorry that happened to you lets try to move past it together youd feel more supported and positive about the whole thing the underlying message is basically the same you cant do anything about the fact you were raped and can only move on with your life but the tone and message that you actually receives ends up very different and since youre being too sensitive is a very simplistic and reductionist phrasing it will effectively always lose any of that important nuance thus why i say its not a useful viewpoint whether right or wrong it doesnt help anyone understand

about racism its been very thoroughly studied i provided links for you japans racism is extremely well documented im not sure what youre looking for at this point im well aware of the racism in japan im fucking korean ive had more than my fair share of media outlining the shortcomings of japan you did because if you had read it you wouldnt have made the points you did im still waiting for you to tell me why you are trying to compare the deaths of blacks to the nation as a whole population and not the demographic that matters why you are trying to pick apart japan when i listed a half dozen other countries with similar issues and how you think that racism is exclusively and american problem because im not talking about black americans were on a comment thread about peter lin not blacks which is exactly why i said its not relevant to what im trying to talk about yes so minuscule you just linked to a site talking about what japan did in foreign wars and democide what does that have to do with racism within a country are you being serious like really serious right now i dont know how you can say that western media covers korean protests just as much as they do any other nation the

you call not wanting a single group of people to have an innate advantage over the rest of the world do you not see why one would prefer to avoid that situation thats what i call refusing to promote a

with your view quite a bit almost everyone even just a hundred years ago held views that are hopelessly morally backward by todays standards and knowing that for example woodrow wilson was horribly racist makes it more difficult to appreciate any of his positive accomplishments the key here though is that almost everyone was that way we didnt come up with our morals today out of nowhere we learned them from people around us the question isnt am i a better person than someone from the s but would i have been any better if id grown up then judging them for being morally backwards because they were racist sexist and so on is a little bit like judging them for being technologically backwards because they hadnt invented the internet yet that isnt to say we can or should ignore the actual evils of the time and frankly some of the people in the past held views that were backwards or abhorrent even for their time and society and perhaps we might judge them for that but on the whole its not particularly fair to judge a historical figure for what would be a moral failing in a modern person if we were to judge them at all it would be for the positions and beliefs they took on what were the leading moral debates of their time someone from the s probably shouldnt be judged for racism when everything in society told them they should be racist but it would be fair to ask where they stood on slavery\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 896\n","comment: your brother is still a human being that experiences life and enjoys it in his own way it is selfish for you to want to kill him because

much you can spare without seriously impacting your quality of life while many of us struggle to get by thats where the resentment comes from because you could do it but choose not to please dont view that last sentence as an attack i do believe its your money and you can do with it as you wish but understand that with the resources you have available people will judge you on how you spend that money again im not saying that keeping your money makes you a bad person i think you sound like a good person im just trying to explain why some people dislike the rich without knowing anything about

a secularization of it its been turned more into a personal belief system than a political movement islam is still as much of a political movement as christianity was in the dark ages which is why it is so violent as a result what the muslim world needs is secularization to temper their problems all religions can be spun to endorse all kinds of shitty things its really more dependent on economic conditions education and quality of life of the religions followers at the point in time not the religion itself i disagree with this ignoring islam for the moment which i think we can all agree have calls to violence lets look at christianity deuteronomy specifically says to kill your kids if they disobey you eat too much are drunks etc a true christian should follow this rule set down by their holy scripture why dont they its simple there is another source that has a higher influence on their morals than that of their religion many muslims have reached this point as well but not enough to

entirely different ideas and are almost contradictory to each other in inclination climate change is merely a broader spectrum term to explain the potential of global warming climate change as an ideal sometimes supposedly explains why some places are colder as a result of both natural and manmade climate change because obviously the entire globe can not warm if places get colder you can not have global warming be a thing while climate change explains why things also get colder hence why it is contradictory again why its difficult to take it seriously when they can not seem to get their

are taking a better safe than sorry approach touche on that youre right humans certainly can believe some silly things especially when crowd mentality kicks in vaccinationautism hysteria comes to mind i think where the distinction is made for climate change is the overwhelming scientific consensus i know its annoying to keep hearing that over and over science is hard to understand and many people are not scientifically literate enough to be shown graphsdatatrendsclimate models and make unbiased conclusions based off of them especially in the span of a minute news report i think thats why

noticed that the total column water vapor shows a clear increase with a trend line and everything of the atmospheres ability to retain water vapor which is positively correlated with an increase in mean temperature literally every piece of pristine data that you cited shows an increase in temperature over the last decade you just need to accept the fact that you are wrong about this and move on

producing energy that is affecting the climate the problem is that we are producing gasses co and ch which make earth absorb more energy from the sun see page of thishttpwwwsandiagovjytsaosolarfaqspdf for the a rough estimate of the total amount of energy striking the earths surface from the sun from that you can see the amount of energy humans produce is pitiful the way we have an impact on global temperature is by making earth keep more of that total sunlight as for the amount of energy it takes to increase the surface temperature of earth by deg im really not sure this is the kind of thing you would have to read papers to extract but it is kind of unimportant for our purposes if you want to make predictions then it is important the primary problem is that by making earth better at holding onto the suns energy we have offset the equilibrium in the direction of heating by a significant amount earth will continue to increase in temperature until it reaches the new equilibrium even if that new equilibrium is only slightly higher than the temp is now it will have a lot of damaging effects i would also like to say that my example in the last comment is wildly inaccurate and just there to make a point earth should emit roughly the same amount as it absorbs otherwise we would see the temperature change very quickly the ratio of emitabsorb should be very close to but not exactly at as there are other sources and our avg temp is changing just very slowly on human scales fast on geologic scales\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 982\n","comment: hitler was a socialist no actually he

less but do you not this kind of identity is the reason civil rights struggles were waged for in the first place if one insists on sticking to a racial identity it is definitely problematic your actions might have more of an influence on the people around you instead of other people in your race for example perhaps you ought to be more concerned about their behaviour instead of the behaviour of other black people at an extreme this sort of closed identity can go down to your street or your building as well but it has the flipside of excluding those outside of it i might be a bit meandering here but imagine that black people did tip more than the average or that you were white do you think you ought to give up on the idea of making amends for those who tipped less just because you werent of the same race do you think a white person ought not to be concerned about a low average tip just because it was black people who brought the average down\n","label:

inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others over the past hours in particular weve seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension twitter banned milo for inciting this abuse something that

to detonation whether this is due to antimissile shields laser technology or targeted emps it does not matter once nukes are a nonfactor the single largest strategic problem with going to war with another country is gone states that dont have to worry about their interests being nuked are much more likely to send the ground troops in on your point women and the out of shape i see no reason that our current health problems will stop us from drafting people the training may be longer and more involved but where their is a requirement there is a way in the us military as for women i look forward to the day women are eligible for the draft but just because they are drafted does not mean they will be automatically able or fit to do all jobs they will be assigned to the jobs that they can do well at on point cos you have to prove your co status this has always been true access to info will only make people more ready for it but if more people out ov every do qualify you still have

something they think needs to be stopped then they dont really think it needs to be stopped i think you would have a better time pulling up polling data or appealing to common sense about other ways in which prolife arguments are inconsistent in the grand scheme its not that the priority argument is wrong its perfectly reasonable to assume that people have priorities for everything they do and

latches onto real science for credibility think they are going for respectability by association eg things that were thought of as correct when i was born may not be thought of as such right now in political science amazing you must be really smart but the law of gravity is still the same carbon still has protons etc and america was still founded in abraham lincoln is still the th president etc i guess you need to retake your physics classes the law of gravity has changed over time but i get your point whereas the prevailing political orthodoxy has changed from keeping marginal tax rates high to cutting them and it will swing back you need to take philosophy of science thats not why political science and science is different simplistically speaking its a matter of the application of

is just as common on my side of the debates as the other side demonize their political opponents to an unreasonable degree we humans scientists researchers etc know that the vast majority of human beings construct narratives for themselves that make them the good guy in our society i dont see it as possible to avoid discussing politics because so many topics are politicized teaching science youre taking a political position discuss health care in any fashion political discuss sex education political bullying shouldnt be allowed and your example certainly takes it too far but its a quantitative difference not a qualitative one there is no debate to teach when it comes to certain facets of science what you describe is extreme polarization and it should be avoided but to avoid all

authorised to make arrests or use force in order to perform their duties if it is indeed the case that the security officials were transportation security officials then it is not illegal to resist their application of force as they are not authorised to do so in the first place additionally the man would be justified in resisting this application of force by unqualified and unauthorised officers if it is the case that the officers were police officers then your point still stands even if the officers were police officers we should first ask if the officers responded appropriately before we push the blame solely onto the passenger if it is the case that the officers responded disproportionately out of protocol or in escalation then the officers are also held partially accountable for any injury resulting from their actions as an extreme example to illustrate the point if an officer began to beat someone for jaywalking with a baton even if the jaywalker resisted the

power into an ever smaller group of people and worse is doing so in an entirely subjective manner itd be one thing if your criteria were objective eg college degree x years of military service etc but youre basically allowing individuals to make an entirely subjective judgement as to who gets to vote or not and then pretending they wont abuse that power to reduce the risks of this you could interview those people not by a single person but a small jury and who gets to decide the jury not to mention now youve made the administration of the problem worse since now you have to get an entire jury of people together to decide to gets to vote and trying to get that system to work across an eligible base of around million people first i was thinking of france so now youre moving the goalposts but you still have around million eligible voters to deal with and you seriously want to do this for every single issue thats not national security related are you nuts of course it would be a massive process but i dont think its impossible and what if its for the best of our nation and who gets to decide whats in the best interest of the nation if not the nation itself as an aside i find

any bars labelled long term social change which is what both of us agree is a good way to limit danger thats not the point the fact is a person defending themselves with a gun limits injury to themselves far more than any other defense method limiting the chances of that thing happening to that person at all is for a separate debate you cant just discount them to fit your weak argument ill reiterate that the level of gun control i think we should eventually reach is not the level i think is appropriate now i dont care what matters is people carrying guns saves lives secondly read a book is not an argument im giving you detailed explanations of why i think what i do which you term twisting facts youre simply stating youre disagreement in most places no you have no idea what a right actually is so your opinion on the matter hold zero authority okay granted by who or what the fact that you are human the fact that i dont need to tell you to want to live the fact that i dont need to tell you to protect and value your property the fact that i dont need to tell you to speak whats on your mind the fact that being human makes you feel compelled by all of those things thats where

definition of morality i would limit it only to life which can experience utility if the life doesnt care if it is hurt than it is not being hurt this means that it is moral to cut down a tree excluding the affect on beings other than the tree or kill bacteria i think this is the same idea you were going for so wont spend a lot of time on it next i dont understand how you go from i am only myself not all life to i only have to care about myself if we can agree that utility is the mist important thing than why dont we want to maximize it as much as possible you say if helping other people also helps you and only if it helps you will you do it i agree that is every persons imperative because everyone wants to maximize their personal happiness however i disagree that it is the moral thing to do i say that doing the action that maximizes utility for all beings is the moral action and understand that is a different action than what people will actually do one thing which i dont understand is what moral imperative is as i understand it it means the action one is compelled to do based on what is right but the context you put it in makes it sound like moral responsibility what is the difference if it is responsibility i have a reply for that but i dont want to make an unnecessary argument could you explain what that phrase means\n","label: none\n","\n","id:

christians dont literally believe the world was created in days and i suspect the same is true of jews the historical figure of jesus who was likely a real person whether you believe in the divine

christmas it doesnt change the significance of their holiday that the reason behind it is factually incorrect the same is true of passover its a good holiday with a good message behind it even if the

ethical change take all the different kinds of christianity we have today protestantism catholicism orthodox and tell me that they all sport exactly the same unchanged morals thats right they dont over hundreds of years many different churches and groups have interpreted religion in their own way and then turned that into some form of moral structure although it may not have always been for the better it was change why did some saxon tribe go from ceremonial war dances to reciting the lords prayer before battle because religion changed how they behaved and then it continued to change them after that take john ball as a specific example of how religion can promote moral growth he lived in a time at which feudalism was still around where the king was supposedly chosen by divine right and a large quantity of the population were essentially slaves what did he do to fight these injustices he called upon the bible of course stating that no man had the right to elevate him self where in the eyes of god we were all created equal see frossiarts chronicles or herehttpenwikipediaorgwikijohnballpriest for more info ball was not the only one who sought to change ethics through religion though look at wycliffe the diggers or anyone who challenged their contemporary systems in the name of their gods also the thing about getting stuck in religious texts is a bit silly churchesgroups have always interpreted holy books in their own way which is why we have so many different sects of each religion lastly i agree that basing your morals on year old books is a bit odd but at the same

suffering a silent and completely invisible form of ptsd that only you are qualified to diagnose you claim that abused animals will still wag their tails at their owners so how are you able to measure this distress in any quantifiable way have you brought up this amateur theory with any veterinarians do you think theyre likely to concede that leaving a dog alone for hours constitutes abuse do you know what my dog does when im not at home he flips on his back and sleeps he does this until i get home and then we go for a walk at some point he eats dog food and i give him a good pet this is his life and its a pretty great one compared to the life he would lead on the street or in the wild or euthanized in some shelter what youre saying is so completely ludicrous on its face that i cant believe you arent totally embarrased to even write it down for other people to see youre basically arguing that every dog in new york city with working owners is as of right now being abused if you

the same time i agree with a fair amount of what you are saying he could have a better life but the existence of a better life does not necessarily mean his life is bad this is my main point he was a rescue dog he needed a home or he would spend the rest of his probably short life in a kennel at the pound he is much happier with us than what his fate would be if he was not adopted now he might have had a better household adopt him my counter to this is a household goes out expressly to adopt a dog they then adopt approximately the number of dogs they intended to get from the beginning this means if a better household adopted my dog they would not have adopted what ever dog they actually wound up with so there would still be a dog in a kennel waiting for a home or death edit decided to add more in something to think about how exciting is your life while you are at work if you have a cubicle job like many people than you have less room then your dog does how good a life do we need to provide for our pets that is so much higher then our own life would you tell people they should not live their lives because they can only do fun things for a few hours every day why is a dogs life so much different dont forget what the alternative is for current dogs in this predicament the only way to get them out is to kill them for future dogs you must answer this question is it better to be

defiantly not every publisher nor will it fully ruin the future of gaming have you heard of the publisher paradox interactive they are probably the main reason i have faith in the future of gaming and other minor publishers and indie devs and the reasons i like them is probably also the reason they have grown a whole lot more popular in the past few years those reason being they have great communication with the community and they have a usually great dlc policy especially compared to other publishers as far as im care their games always feel complete upon release and whenever they release a dlc it is accompanied by a fair bit of free content which benefits everyone even years after release yeah they do some bullshit things to with their cosmetic dlc but at least that doesnt effect the gameplay i also have high hopes for some more popular franchises like fallout last time when skyrim came out the preorder bonus was an out of game map the dlcs also seemed reasonable and complete and so far then have done nothing to show that f will be any different anyways i have only bought one or two aaa title in the past two or so years primarily because of the reasons you have mentioned its a sad problem and will probably always be around but it will never be everywhere if people like you give your money to developers who arent sleazy but there are so many other great games

lying about it and derailing the whole debate into his little tirade “ free will ” is a philosophical term of art for a particular sort of capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives which is exactly the definition i used that hq said was wrong this stands true for all the subsequent forms of free will that follow for each variety of determinism there are philosophers who i deny its reality either because of the existence of free will or on independent grounds ii accept its reality but argue for its compatibility with free will or iii accept its reality and deny its compatibility with free will with this the entry introduces at least different versions of free will all of which contain my initial definition and out of which the one the op gave as the gods true definition is only one of its actually you who have have have forfeited the argument by moving away from the issue at hand going into a rant on the metadiscussion and claiming some sort of accusation of malintent here in the presence of a perfectly reasonable response wrong this whole thing started with hq claiming the ops definition of free will was wrong and subsequently doing it to me as well despite my definition being the common one that is included in all of the other versions later hq forced me to pick a subpath which still doesnt change the fact that what i said is a part of all the versions and what he said is only a part of one of them that is exactly what intellectual dishonesty is knowing something and still claiming something else because it seems like

one of the definitions to be the more prominent definition this is an inherent problem of language take for example the sentence the bartenders punch was quite strong if i said this to you there are two completely valid assumptions the first that the bartender has struck with their fist someone or something near the speaker the second that the bartender mixes a highly alcoholic drink in the argument here you say being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is moral grandstanding then when someone offers you a definition of the possibly unconditional acceptance of tolerance you explain that your own definition is the one you are choosing to take but you are not in a position to make that statement as you are not the original speaker or one who identifies with the statement it is equivalent to use the previous example of saying the bartenders punch is strong and you arguing that the bartender is wrong for hitting things when the original speaker was just talking about their beverage once clarification of language is offered you do not have the ability to argue that another definition was originally being used because it has been clarified if the person you are arguing with is using b to accept despite this direction would be a valid counterargument but they arent so the counterargument of i choose to use another definition despite your clarification in order to maintain my previously held views falls a bit flat in many ways the statement being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is an argumentatively unclear statement but its repetition has likely seen the increase of its use\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 1654\n","comment: please if you had a brain it was fucking obvious this was a war of choice which is a war crime the rest of the dumb public were

making assumptions based on your platonic ideal for instance suppose the average of some series seems out of the ordinary relative to its comparables well how do you know that taking the average was the right thing some series dont have a stable average because their outliers are so extreme in real life you will never get to take the limit as the sample size approaches infinity for obvious reasons you will simply have to make a subjective judgement as to when you have seen enough the idea of a series with a stable average is a nice platonic ideal it may not entirely correspond to

that way its really easy to do but if the toilet seat is up i wont notice until i sit down thats why leave the toilet seat down exists thats why it is sensible if you dont think so i really dont care you dont have to why are you even fucking arguing about it go argue with someone else about meaningless crap im just explaining to you why it makes sense to choose the toilet seat down as the default position rather than up there is a logic to it it is actually sensible holy shit some people on the internet\n","label: ah\n","\n","id: 1731\n","comment: i mean you dont have to say it that way you can just say sorry but in your head mean im sorry you feel that way the problem seems to be that you dont want to let them win but this situation isnt really about that when it comes down to it its about trying not to make people feel bad if someone believes something so far from what you believe that you dont think you could ever reconcile it its probably best to not be around that person however if you care about these people its more about figuring out what upsets them and then avoiding those things when youre around them ill give you an extreme example if i think its totally cool to shit on the floor and i go to someones house for a party and just openly take a big ol shit on the floor i think there may be some issues that arise likely that person would take offense here there are two options if i care more about keeping my identity my right to defecate where i please etc ill likely tell the person that its not my problem theyre offended by me take me as i am or not at all that type of thing if i care more about the relationship i would instead clean up after myself and apologize then later id ask what the issue was exactly and discuss how to not upset them in that way anymore of course this is much more extreme than your case but hopefully the point comes across\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 1732\n","comment: the bernie thing was a strategy that worked so shitting

state department protocols and procedures as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping in response clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and state department regulations and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts the issue is that the emails were retroactively classified as sensitive information up to secret and top secret however nearly emails on the server were retroactively marked as classified by the state department including emails deemed secret and deemed top secret government policy reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information should be considered and handled as classified even if not marked as such so the issue is whether or not she should have known that the classified secret or top secret information in particular should have been on a private email server also one

of verbal abuse well you have the choice to ignore it so why are you so sensitive it is a slippery slope to tell people they are being cruel by discussing an event that actually happened if the person is embarrassed by it that is really on them to accept history and move on it is also a bit different than normal verbal abuse because we are not going to these families directly and mocking them we are laughing at events far away from them it would be like an overweight person being offended that i said something against fat people that they heard second hand was i really being cruel when i never intended that person to hear what i said like i said to me its pretty insensitive to be a stickler here you said it was cruel it doesnt meet the standard of cruelty\n","label: none\n","\n","id:

longwinded yeah youre honestly all over the place and i think if you want to do a cmv thread you need to have your thoughts organized and focus in on specific topics one at a time secondly i dont mean to be rude but you are being unnecessarily verbose honestly youre pretty close to a riamverysmart behavior is complex but youve managed to over complicate some things behavior has some biological basis our justice system doesnt always take this into account and is based off the idea that we need to assign blame rather than understanding the behavior itself these simple sentences capture your overly verbose comments just take a step back organize your thoughts and realize that you dont necessarily need to flip through a thesaurus to explain them\n","label: ah\n","\n","id: 1973\n","comment: i think its more that you are reacting to different things in the music im not a musical expert but i think as an expert you are able to focus on key details in an otherwise ok performance that make you happy to listen while others simply dont see the value that doesnt make them unreasonable im much more comfortable talking about food and drinks so ill use a cocktail metaphor i might go to a bar and get a beautifully executed manhattan i appreciate the complexity of the drink and how simply balanced it is but if i go up to a random person on the street and ask them to drink ittheyll find it completely unpleasant this doesnt make their standards unreasonably high or mine unreasonably low it just means we see different things in the same product\n","label: none\n","\n","id:

disagreement because you have a chip on your shoulder only said your feelings on that particular subject were immature not that you were immature although with the way youre reacting to the word im inclined to think you either subconsciously believe yourself to be immature or you have a deepseated fear of being seen as it your response was in context to mine and contradictory to your response to your only other child dont lie when its obvious the views held by those in less developed countries especially muslim ones are also immature their beliefs are less developed because theyre held back by patriarchal superstitions of course that does nothing to address my issue youre just changing the subject because you have no response perhaps my views arent very well developed if that were the case you would probably see me acting defensive and upset as a means of escaping the cognitive dissonance of you being inescapably right my arguments would become frantic and nonsensical i would invent strawman for you to argue against because my own arguments would be lacking you know kinda like you did last post and are doing now or maybe i do know what im talking about and if you want to discredit me youre gon na have to try a little harder than a baseless implication youre the kind of person who will never admit when theyre wrong fun to play with but not worth engaging with without

gone in that direction so thumbs up for showing me a previously unknown perspective if the people who posted homophobic crap instead kept it to themselves perhaps you and they could be friends and given that im bi i would have been friends with people who think i should be a second class citizen or burn in hell naturally i dont think i need those people to be my friends nor would they be if thats how they think of me and people like me perhaps your friendship might change their homophobia and either way perhaps your relationship could be good despite the political differences i dont think i have the obligation to change their views also having witnessed the nature and ferocity of their posts i came to the conclusion they belong in the not worth it category and simply removed them theres also that option where you dont have to defriend someone you can just hide their posts some political differences are more important than others and can affect relationships beyond repair is this a fair assumption i know multiple people who i consider friends and without whom my life would be poorer who can not do this have you discussed it with them have you tried to show them a different perspective in what way you are actually living a better life by posting by not stressing over things like that by not spending time deciding whether or not im too afraid to say what i think because someone might not like me by staying true to myself and by drawing the attention of others to issues that are important to me thus allowing them to know me better and also maybe change their views for the better as well edit a word\n","label: none\n","\n","id: 1982\n","comment: i didnt mean to attack you on a personal level but with that attitude should you really be speaking for elderly

the boat club you want to think that developing countries are of a lower level be my guest but at least under developed countries help each other out of the kindness of their heart not because a

ability to never misspeak or have such hollow speeches that nothing can be taken out of context is not a good indicator of someone who will be a good legislator or executive in the current climate of

says it may be as high as double without showing their reasoning you are also drawing a lot of strong conclusions without exactly explaining why especially talking about up to million people disappearing not having a terrible immediate effect on the industries that employ them and people magically moving to wherever these vacated and often seasonal jobs will be my point is simply dont use such strong statements unless you can back them up well also when all you do is saying everything will be better that also doesnt give you credence especially the illegal immigrants commit of murders

particularly knowledgeable people and have learned that they always need to do their own research before believing something as long as you change your mind and dont actually hold a certainty of your correctness that definition would seem to mean that youre not selfrighteous what does being amenable to discussionargument changing your mind have to do with it\n","label: none\n","\n","id:

people sure as hell dont apparently you have no clue what communism is it is an economy owned and operated by the workers everyone you obviously are owned and operated by the capitalists and their propaganda that keeps you in chains there will always be some people who are only fulfilled if they can open their down business and be their own boss while i disagree with your assertion that scenario is not incompatible with communism as long as they dont force anyone to work for them as in this economywork in the capitalists conditions or die is force and they dont steal i guess the answer has always been to kill or imprison or re educate i guess you cant think for yourself you have to believe those who imprison you how many people does your capitalist owned state kill or

you will need to commit to doing something you are afraid you wont be able to do you will have to put your trust in something or someone you arent sure you can trust people commonly marry and raise children and both undertakings are fraught with uncertainty a religious background can help people take on things that are larger and more complicated than they are capable of understanding younger people are often dismayed when they discover they were raised by people who are apparently delusional they become like plato searching for the wisest of all men the truth is no one has all the answers everyone is winging it to some extent the ability to wing it is a very useful skill its not inherently harmful for people to believe in a benevolent god whether he exists or not but for younger people

children together its too risky with what we know does this opinion marginalize people yes it does but it is also valid rational and logically supported would you respect this opinion\n","label:

case that there are many different forms of the institutions resulting that your whole life can be lived within the confines of this group then may i suggest that your view shift its focus on religion into this i believe the government has a responsibility to network and expose children to multiple views and supportive communities is far more universally applicable this is basically what public education is after all just a mandatory version of it singling out religion creates a contradiction if this is your reason then you should want the same for all situations that it applies to religion

the present an ovum is a cell it will always be a cell until other stimuli affect it it is like not a zygote which will slowly make a human given no external stimuli you need to meaningfully distinguish between future people that are ok to prevent and future humans are are not ok to prevent there are no future people that are okay to prevent where did you get that also judging a beings value on its future seems to suggest that the deathbed murder i mentioned earlier would be ok i never weighed the values of human futures they all hold the same intrinsic value by existing that is not for humans to determine the fact is every potential future person needs something in the present to ensure they are a person in the future oh my god are you actually retarded that is exactly my point

complete change here i will take it please see comment rule in sidebar you keep saying it but provide nosupport why should a county have to deal with its criminals they have a hereditary entitlement to living there since their ancestors still contributed to the country its unfair but its the same principle as inheriting a big sum of money from your parents you didnt work for it or particularly merited it it just happened that your parents were rich why is hereditary right less revocable than residence right given to immigrants you propose a change in laws as long as we are changing laws why not do it right its more than a change in laws its a deep change in mentalities which is needed no one cares about repeat offender criminals i am sure there is as much support for my rule as for your immigrant rule no one you have let them in and gave them residency they have a right to be there you cant just evict them randomly they have a right to be there as long as they honor their part of the contract if they dont nothing forces the country to still respect its part why should not this reasoning apply to hereditary rights you have right as long you honor your part of the contract and dont
